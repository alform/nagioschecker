Hi Petr
Thanks for writing the Nagios checker.  I have a suggestion for you.
Some background.  The company I work for leases 16 dedicated servers and
has many shared hosting accounts with many other hosting companies, all
for hundreds of domains of varying degrees of importance to our operations.
(BTW, this domain is hosted with the company I used to work for).
I have the sound effects configured to alert me on update if a new problem
appears.  With as many things as we're monitoring there's always several
critical services, service warnings and hosts down.  The problem is that
it seems that the sound file chosen is not that appropriate to the worst
kind of problem that has appeared since the previous check but to the worst
kind of problem of all those displayed.
As an example, I have some services down and one host down.  The checker
updates and there's a new service down.  But the sound file chosen is not
that for a service being down (which is the only new thing to appear) but
for a host being down (which is old news).
I don't know if that was a deliberate decision on your part of a coding
error.  If deliberate, could you add an option for the sound file to
reflect only new problems rather than the worst problem?
